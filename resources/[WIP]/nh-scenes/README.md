# nh-scenes
Interactive Scene Creator for FiveM


# Information
I play on NoPixel primarily and I got inspired to make a similar scenes system to what they have, I believe every roleplay server should have a system like this as it's a powerful tool for roleplay. It's very resource friendly and simple to use. Enjoy!

# Setup
It's pretty simple, once you drop the nh-scenes resource into your resources folder just make sure you put

`ensure nh-scenes`

in your server.cfg.

While in your server have your players bind the 3 keys in Settings > Keybindings > FiveM

You can place a scene by holding the `Place Scene` key and pressing it again when you are happy with the placement, filling out the information using my other resource [nh-keyboard](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-standalone-nerohiro-s-keyboard-dynamic-nui-keyboard-input/2506326) and place away!

if you wish not to use my keyboard resource, you can easily hook it up to your own.

You can also toggle the scenes on and off, and delete scenes you are looking at by binding those keys too.
